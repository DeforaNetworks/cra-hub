#### Am I subject to the CRA if I only contribute to an open source project?

No. Contributions to an open source project are explicitely not in scope of the CRA. See [Recital 18](): 

> This Regulation does not apply to natural or legal persons who contribute with source code to products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software that are not under their responsibility.
